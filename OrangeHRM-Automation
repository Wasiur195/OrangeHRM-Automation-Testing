Assigned Work Scenerio:
log in as a admin to https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/

Go to PIM menu and create a new employee. Save the employee firstname, lastname, employeeid, username and password into JSONArray file. Generate random password which meets following criteria: For a strong password, please use a hard to guess combination of text with upper and lower case characters, symbols and numbers. Assert if employee is created successfully.

Now go to the dashboard again and search by the employee id to check if the employee is found (could not generate because in the dashboard panel, there is no search functionality exist. There i have search the employee username from ADMIN tab)

Now go to the Directory menu and search by employee name and check if the employee is found

Logout the session.
